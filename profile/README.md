## Earth System Modelling Group at TUM and PIK 

Hello there, we are the Earth System Modelling Group at [Technical University Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/esm/startseite/) and the Future Lab Artificial Intelligence in the Anthropocene Group at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene). Here, we collect material and information about our teaching, mostly at TUM.
