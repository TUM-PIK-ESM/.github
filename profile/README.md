Hello there, we are the [Earth System Modelling Group at Technical University Munich (TUM)](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/esm/startseite/) and the [Future Lab Artificial Intelligence in the Anthropocene Group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene).
